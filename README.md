Project developed by  [@MahatKC](https://www.github.com/MahatKC), [@AmandaIsrael](https://www.github.com/AmandaIsrael) and [@spalshzzz](https://github.com/spalshzzz) in 2021.

This project was an assignment for the Artificial Intelligence class we took in our 3rd year of Computer Science.

Developed in Python based on the [Super Mario AI project by Octavio Santiago](https://github.com/octavio-santiago/Super-Mario-Land-AI), it trains a genetic algorithm to play Super Mario Land. Massive changes were made to Octavio's code, but unfortunately the algorithm did not manage to finish the first level even after a couple of days of training.
